# Desktop Todo app

A project inspired by the [Todo App on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building real projects.
Built on top of other technologies, more details about them are down below.

Here's an example of what it looks like on a desktop device.
